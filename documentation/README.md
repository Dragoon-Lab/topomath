This folder contains the documentation for important modules of the system. Some implementation details, object requirements and descriptions to help anyone who wants to understand what the system does.

TopoMath is an Intelligent Tutoring System which will teach students dynamic system modeling. It is a precursor to the older version called [Dragoon](https://github.com/Dragoon-Lab/LaitsV3). Currently, we plan to use the system for high school students to help them study Algebra.

### Modules ###
Major modules of the system are :

* [Model Object - Author and Student](model.md)
* [Node Editor](node_editor.md)
* [User interface - Model](ui_model.md)
* [Event Logging](logging.md)
